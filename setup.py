With its ability to "translate the history" from one VCS kind to another,
this script makes it easier to keep the upstream changes merged in
a own branch of a product.

Tailor is able to fetch the history from Arch, Bazaar-NG, CVS, Darcs
Monotone or Subversion and rewrite it over Bazaar-NG, CVS, Darcs, Git,
Mercurial, Monotone and Subversion.
