# Revision: 603a9ccf04cfd6ec7e991a15b51f7effe34b95bc
# Date: 2007-06-14 22:38:21+00:00
# Author: key-dummy
# Entries: dir1(DEL at 603a9ccf04cfd6ec7e991a15b51f7effe34b95bc), dir2/a(REN from dir1/a), dir2/b(REN from dir1/b)
#
# Implementation should:
# Sort the DEL and REN entries by pathname (bottom up). But must use the oldpath of REN.
# 1. REN from dir2/a
# 2. REN from dir1/a
# 3. DEL      dir1
#
# This should also work for multiple DEL of directories, for example:
# 1. REN from dir3/dir2/dir1/file
# 2. DEL      dir3/dir2/dir1
# 3. DEL      dir3/dir2
#
# Fixed with patch 'monotone-dir-move-and-del.patch'
#
# ERROR 2:
# --------
# After convert back from Subversion to Monotone, the dirs are added instead renamed
