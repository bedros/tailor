# Test for converting revisions from Monotone to Monotone self.
# It's a selfchecking for Monotone.  Diff between test1.log and test2.log
# should no have difference.

# It checks new working "automate certs" for multiple heads, Tag, Testresult,
# multi-line Changelogs, multiple Comments, multi-line Comments.
#
# ToDo: Testresult should be sort back into Monotone.
# Log-diff: differ (no support for multiple heads).
