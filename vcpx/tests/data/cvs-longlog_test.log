Recoded migration walkers to use a generator instead returning a list to make them much more memory efficient.

Rewritten folder migration to use the depth inside the folder structur instead of recursing into the full side.

Added a findStaledObjects external method to ATCT to find staled objects. It is very useful to clean up a site before running the migration.
